Tutorial

Hello there! I'm a new user of GitHub. As a theoretical computational physicist, 
it's important to me to have a way to track back to my own codes and remmember
how I solved some recurrent problem. 
Recently I became interented to colaborate in (or create some) code projects in 
community. GitHub will help me in these two goals.
